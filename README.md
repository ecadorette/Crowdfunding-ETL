## Overview
In this project, Python and Jupyter Notebook are used to extract and transform data into four CSV files from the provided data. Then, the files were imported into pgAdmin and SQL queries were built to provide insight into campagin and contact data for the customer. Later, backer data was added as well to answer more questions for the customer. 

Files saved include:
- DB model showing the relationships and data types of the five .csv files
- a SQL source file showing the code used to build the tables in pgAdmin
- a Jupyter source file showing the extracting and trasforming of the data using python
- exported tables showing the data analysis from SQL
